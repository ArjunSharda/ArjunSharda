Hey everyone!

I am ajsharda17, the founder of <a href="https://github.com/MakingBotsFun">Making Bots Fun</a>, <a href="https://youtube.com/chairbf">an youtuber</a>, and fullstack developer.

This github account will consist of my code that I have for the public, it will have code that give examples of different programming languages, and some open sourced stuff I have for the public.
